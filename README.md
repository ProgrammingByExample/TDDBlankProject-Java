# Blank test project
This is a blank test project for article readers to begin coding without providing full instructions of it's creation.
The reason it exists is to lower friction and ensure the article is not filled with instructions one could look up from Microsoft - which would also be continually up to date.
This code seeks to provide a small project with a few tests which may be played around with or simply viewed to gain further understanding.
